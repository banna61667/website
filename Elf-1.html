				<p> I had an amazing time during this trip at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mammoth+Lakes,+CA+93546/@37.6269859,-119.0144195,13.34z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x80960c5f79b3179f:0xf114d9d70fee8d6d!8m2!3d37.648546!4d-118.972079" target="_blank">Mammoth</a>.It was surprisingly going to be my first time going to Mammoth, so I was unsure as to how cold it would be and the landscape of the trip. It was also going to be my first time mountain biking, and my initial expectation of mountain biking was a bunch of bikers quickly biking down a steep hill while trying to weave through trees and rocks. This trip beat my expectations and proved to me how fun mountain biking truly is, especially with different people </p>

					<p>My class trip was very fun as I was able to meet new people when we were mountain biking, hiking, and at the campgrounds. I had many firsts during this trip, and mountain biking was the biggest of all of them. Although I got hurt, slipped, and fell along the pathway towards our destination, my new friends helped me and gave me time to learn.</p>

				<p>Mammoth has been through a lot on a geographical and historical level. I remember reading about wildfires and natural disaasters that occured in Mammoth. It was very interesting, yet devasting to learn about. </p>
				<p>There were many other geographical devastations that occured in Mammoth, such as a grand fault line and the change in lake sizes. In the end, it is breathtaking to look at the landscape and natural life that surrounded us during the trip. I'll never forget the views that I saw at Mammoth. </p>

			<p>This program was very good when it comes to biking actually fun trails, feading us throughout the day, and giving all of us time to relate and do whatever. I really appreciate the organization and clear schedule that the adult leaders were following throughout the trip. I was finally able to do actual biking during this trip in Mammoth.</p>

During one of the biking days, it was hot, rocky, and we were biking a long strip. I was on gear one the whole time, so I was burnt out tired , my legs were pedaling crazy fast, and others were still passing me easily</p></div>';

There were very diverse strategies as some went all in, others never bet, and others(like me sometimes) just kept losing. I won about three times, but other than those wins, my luck was very low.</p></div>';

			'<div id="gears-area"><img src="./Landscape.jpg"><p>The landscapes in Mammoth were just extroardinary and beautiful. There were so many grand mountains, valleys where glaciers passed through millions of years ago, trees of all colors, and bears. A bear actual toured our campgrounds during the last night and stared at Leo and Gabe for a long period of time( classic perspective bears).  </p></div>';

			'<div id="gears-area"><img src="./hike.jpg"><p>During one of the days, we hiked to an abandoned mine. It was pretty cool to look at, we were really high up, the area around us was beutiful, and some of us were trying to throw a rock from above onto an old pipe way below. We were also telling riddles to eachother throughout this hike and the whole trip. Many of us (including me) were riled up after Kekoa told his "riddle" (<b>IT WAS NOT A PARADOX!!</b>). The hike was simple and fun in the end. I enjoyed it, and it got my legs working without hitting a pedal.</p></div>';
