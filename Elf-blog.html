During one of the biking days, it was hot, rocky, and we were biking a long strip. I was on gear one the whole time, so I was burnt out tired , my legs were pedaling crazy fast, and others were still passing me easily</p></div>';

There were very diverse strategies as some went all in, others never bet, and others(like me sometimes) just kept losing. I won about three times, but other than those wins, my luck was very low.</p></div>';

			'<div id="gears-area"><img src="./Landscape.jpg"><p>The landscapes in Mammoth were just extroardinary and beautiful. There were so many grand mountains, valleys where glaciers passed through millions of years ago, trees of all colors, and bears. A bear actual toured our campgrounds during the last night and stared at Leo and Gabe for a long period of time( classic perspective bears).  </p></div>';

			'<div id="gears-area"><img src="./hike.jpg"><p>During one of the days, we hiked to an abandoned mine. It was pretty cool to look at, we were really high up, the area around us was beutiful, and some of us were trying to throw a rock from above onto an old pipe way below. We were also telling riddles to eachother throughout this hike and the whole trip. Many of us (including me) were riled up after Kekoa told his "riddle" (<b>IT WAS NOT A PARADOX!!</b>). The hike was simple and fun in the end. I enjoyed it, and it got my legs working without hitting a pedal.</p></div>';
